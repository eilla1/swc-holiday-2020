# Students Who Code Holiday Challenge 2020

This is my submission for the SWC Holiday Challenge.

The webpage was coded with HTML/CSS. It features Santa, the fictional figure and mascot of Christmas. 

The form at the bottom is powered by Google Forms and Google Apps Script. Upon submitting the form, you will receive a custom PDF holiday card in your email.
