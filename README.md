# Students Who Code Holiday Challenge 2020

This is my submission for the SWC Holiday Challenge.

This website features the fictional character Santa Claus and gives a brief introduction about him.

One notable feature of this project is requesting a holiday card from Santa. The form is powered by Google Forms and Google Forms Apps Script. It sends a customized holiday card to your inbox after you submit the form.
